## To-Do List

This is a To-Do List build using HTML, CSS, Flask.
I have implemented all the basic operations of creating, deleting and updating To-Do tasks.
The data for this application is stored by using sqlalchemy.


Flask:- A vacuum flask is an insulating storage vessel that greatly lengthens the time over which its contents remain hotter or cooler than the flask's surroundings. Invented by Sir James Dewar in 1892
